# YVO<sub>4</sub> Project
The purpose of this project is to grow YVO<sub>4</sub> crystals by a variety of methods, documenting all relevant data and metadata using the GEMD framework. This process will produce scientifically relevant information about the crystals, but also serve as a proof-of-concept for the end-to-end implementation of GEMD and demonstrate the value of the methodology.
